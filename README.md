# OphardtImport

Ophardt is an online platform for managing sports events, particularly in fencing.
Clubs that are interacting with it need to maintain a list of their active members
in the platform.

This is a browser local utility that allows a club administrator to compare the csv
exports of their member management system and ophardt, compare them, and generate
a csv file with the data of the missing people for easy upload into Ophardt.

## Usage

The tool is hosted on GitHub Pages at [darrasse.github.io/ophardt-import/](https://darrasse.github.io/ophardt-import/index.html).
Note that the csv files are treated within the user's browser.
